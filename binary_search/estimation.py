65. Median of two Sorted Arrays
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/description
There are two sorted arrays A and B of size m and n respectively. Find the median of the two sorted arrays.
The median here is equivalent to the median in the mathematical definition.
The median is the middle of the sorted array.
If there are n numbers in the array and n is an odd number, the median is A[(n-1)/2].
If there are n numbers in the array and n is even, the median is (A[n / 2] + A[n / 2 + 1]) / 2.
For example, the median of the array A=[1,2,3] is 2, and the median of the array A=[1,19] is 10.

初看是一道普通的prefixSum题
但考察的prefixSum的剪枝

1.初级解法：
求出prefixSum,通过遍历所有可能的substring
打擂台的方式 求出(prefixSum[i] - prefixSum[j]) / (j - i) 的最小值
由于这个最小值中起决定性作用的有两个条件(prefixSum[i] - prefixSum[j]) 和(j - i)
所以无法用全循环保存最小值的情况来减枝,只能全部遍历所以.
时间复杂度即为完整遍历prefixSum: O(n^2)

2.高级解法：
即假设我们要求的平均值为target，当所有数同时减去target，我们可以去掉(j - i) 这个条件
因为当对所有数同时减去target时，/(j - i) 就变得没有意义了，我们只在乎大于0还是小于0

这样，我们的问题就可以转化为用二分法来寻找满足 target 最大 且满足有subrange为0的target，prefix 仅用作判断条件
时间复杂度为O(nlgn)

786. K-th Smallest Prime Fraction
https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-smallest-prime-fraction/
A sorted list A contains 1, plus some number of primes.  Then, for every p < q in the list, we consider the fraction p/q.
What is the K-th smallest fraction considered?  Return your answer as an array of ints, where answer[0] = p and answer[1] = q.
Examples: Input: A = [1, 2, 3, 5], K = 3 Output: [2, 5]
Explanation: The fractions to be considered in sorted order are: 1/5, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3.
The third fraction is 2/5. Input: A = [1, 7], K = 1 Output: [1, 7]

1439. Find the Kth Smallest Sum of a Matrix With Sorted Rows
You are given an m * n matrix, mat, and an integer k, which has its rows sorted in non-decreasing order.
You are allowed to choose exactly 1 element from each row to form an array. Return the Kth smallest array sum among all possible arrays.
Example 1: Input: mat = [[1,3,11],[2,4,6]], k = 5 Output: 7
Explanation: Choosing one element from each row, the first k smallest sum are: [1,2], [1,4], [3,2], [3,4], [1,6]. Where the 5th sum is 7.
Example 2: Input: mat = [[1,3,11],[2,4,6]], k = 9 Output: 17
Example 3: Input: mat = [[1,10,10],[1,4,5],[2,3,6]], k = 7 Output: 9
Explanation: Choosing one element from each row, the first k smallest sum are: [1,1,2], [1,1,3], [1,4,2], [1,4,3], [1,1,6], [1,5,2], [1,5,3]. Where the 7th sum is 9.
Example 4: Input: mat = [[1,1,10],[2,2,9]], k = 7 Output: 12
