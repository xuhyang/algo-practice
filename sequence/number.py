128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
Follow up: Could you implement the O(n) solution?
Example 1: Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2] Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2: Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1] Output: 9

We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.
Given an integer array nums, return the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.
A subsequence of array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

554. Brick Wall
https://leetcode.com/problems/brick-wall/
There is a brick wall in front of you. The wall is rectangular and has several rows of bricks. The bricks have the same height but different width. You want to draw a vertical line from the top to the bottom and cross the least bricks.
The brick wall is represented by a list of rows. Each row is a list of integers representing the width of each brick in this row from left to right.
If your line go through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You need to find out how to draw the line to cross the least bricks and return the number of crossed bricks.
You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no bricks.

[[1,2,2,1],
 [3,1,2],
 [1,3,2],
 [2,4],
