Given a list accounts, each element accounts[i] is a list of strings,
where the first element accounts[i][0] is a name, and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.
Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person
if there is some email that is common to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.
After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.
Input:
[

Explanation:
The first and third John's are the same person as they have the common email "johnsmith@mail.com".

547. Friend Circles
https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-circles/
There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not.
Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct friend of B,
and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C.
And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.
Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.
Example 1: Input: [[1,1,0], [1,1,0], [0,0,1]]
Output: 2 Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle. The 2nd student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.

In a network of nodes, each node i is directly connected to another node j if and only if graph[i][j] = 1.
Some nodes initial are initially infected by malware. Whenever two nodes are directly connected and at least one of those two nodes is infected by malware, both nodes will be infected by malware. This spread of malware will continue until no more nodes can be infected in this manner.

We will remove one node from the initial list. Return the node that if removed, would minimize M(initial). If multiple nodes could be removed to minimize M(initial), return such a node with the smallest index.
